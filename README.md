# NaiveBayes-MAP-MLE

This repository contains the code for Categorical Naive Bayes Maximum Likelihood (MLE) and Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) Estimators for the EMNIST Dataset.

For MAP, we assume a Dirichlet distribution for the class priors and a Beta distribution for the pixel priors. 

We plot learning curves for MLE and various values of the MAP hyper-parameters and compare the results.

Full problemset for the CS-535 assignment available [here](https://github.com/animesharma/NaiveBayes-MAP-MLE/blob/master/MiniProjectProblems.pdf).
